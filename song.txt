In place of warm is green glass,
In place of fire is smoke.
From calender taken the day.
The red sun burning to ashes,
Day burns with it.
The ray falling on the flaming city.
 
Our hearts require the changes,
Our eyes require the changes,
Into our laugh and our tears,
And into pulse of veins
Changes!
We are waiting for changes.

Our day goes to electric light
And matchbox is empty.
But in the kitchen in blue colour burns the gas.
Cigarettes in hands, cup of tea on the table,
It's simple plan.
And there isn't something else, everything inside of us.
 
Our hearts require the changes,
Our eyes require the changes,
Into our laugh and our tears,
And into pulse of veins
Changes!
We are waiting for changes.
